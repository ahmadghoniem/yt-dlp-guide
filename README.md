3. run yt-dlp -U to update yt-dlb to the latest version (make sure it's a capital U and not lowercase u)
4. use one of the following commands

## Single video

1. Downloads video file

   `yt-dlp -S "res:720" -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL"`

2. Converts a single video to Mp3 format by extracting Audio from a video

   `yt-dlp --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL" --ffmpeg-location "ffmpeg\bin"`

## Playlist

1. Download All playlist videos and saves them into a folder named with playlist's title

   `yt-dlp -S "res:720" -o "%(playlist_title)s\%(title)s.%(ext)s" "YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_URL"`

2. Download playlist videos starting from START to END and saves them into a folder with playlist's title

   `yt-dlp -S "res:720" -I "START:END" -o "%(playlist_title)s\%(title)s.%(ext)s" "YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_URL"`

- FYI: you can replace `%(playlist_title)s\%(title)s.%(ext)s` with `%(playlist_title)s\%(playlist_index)%s- (title)s.%(ext)s`
  to save the video with it's index followed by it's name

## Split by Chapters

1. Downloads video file, split it by chapters and saves them to a folder with the video's title

   `yt-dlp -S "res:720" -o "chapter:%(title)s\%(section_number)s - %(section_title)s.%(ext)s" --split-chapters "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL" --ffmpeg-location "ffmpeg\bin"`

- FYI:you can replace `"chapter:%(title)s\%(section_number)s - %(section_title)s.%(ext)s"` with `"chapter:%(title)s\%(section_title)s.%(ext)s"`
  to save the video with the chapter name only without the index
